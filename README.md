# MASM-Low_Level_IO

This program uses string primitives, macros
and procedures to perform low level I/O operations in x86 Assembly.

The program asks for 10 signed integers from the user as strings. The strings
are converted from ASCII to SDWORDs and stored in an array. Then, their sum,
and the truncated average are calculated. Finally, all numbers entered by the
user as well as the results are converted back to their ASCII representations
and printed as strings.
